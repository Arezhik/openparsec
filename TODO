Below is a VERY short list of things that I brainstormed 
up that need to be done.  Please add to this list if there 
is something you think needs to be done before a beta 
release with Game Server Code can go out.

NETWORK CODE
	- Implement the rest of the weapons and such
	  for the RE interface in the game server code
	- Figure out a way to implement the swarm 
	  missile code, I can see no way to do it using
	  the current missile code.  I could be wrong.
	- Investigate problems with extra collision detection
	  It doesn't always notify the client of a detection,
	  and from testing with engery boosters, doesn't always
	  boost the energy correctly.
	- Test all implementations for bugs.
	- Set up ignore code for unknown RE's to the server ??????
AUDIO CODE
  - a problem exists with clicking in the background
    player, low priority, but needs fixing.
    
GENERAL CODE
	- Implement a "easy to use" client side game server
	  connect interface.  I think this one might already
	  be there, just not implemented.
	- Clean up UI and remove(hide) unused buttons from the menus
	  until they are implemented.
