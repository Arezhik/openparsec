    - fixes for Win32 build, committing a new vcproj file
    - did some more fixup on audio code, changed the buffer
      size to 4096 to help with some skipping.  Works in win32
      will test more in Linux later.

    - took out the openal lib hooks
    - added sdl_mixer audio support
    - fixed assert code in linux so it no longer
      segfaults but actually asserts with usable
      messages
    - Fixed and implemented mine collision code
      in peer to peer mode.  This was previously
      causing an assert.
    - took out a bunch of unneeded MSGOUT's and 
      LOGOUT's in the game server code.
